Hello! I'm currently a PhD Candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Northwestern University. I work with Dr. Molly Bright in the [Applied Neuro-Vascular Imaging Lab](https://www.brightlab.northwestern.edu/). 

I use an technique called functional MRI (fMRI) to image the human spinal cord. My research focus is in developing analyses for improved data de-noising as well as application of this technique to learn about vascular and motor function of the spinal cord. Additionally, I am using spinal cord fMRI in conjunction with electromyography (EMG) to study motor impairment. Through this work I am experienced in experimental design, signal & image processing, and data visualization. I'm also interested in data science and AI.
